# Booker

**Schedule meetings in 30 seconds, not 30 emails**

The only scheduling tool that works without forcing everyone to create accounts. Start with zero friction, upgrade to calendar connections for 5-second responses, and watch your company's scheduling time drop by 90%.

## Why Booker?

**The Problem:** Fortune 500 companies won't mandate third-party calendar apps. Doodle and When2Meet require manual entry every time. Calendly needs 1:1 approvals that don't scale.

**The Solution:** The Intelligent Availability Network™
1. **Start Simple:** No account needed - just click and drag (15-20 seconds)
2. **Whitelist After First Use:** "Auto-share with them" or "Trust their whole company"
3. **Bilateral Pressure:** When they whitelist you, you feel compelled to reciprocate
4. **Network Effects:** Each interaction makes the next one exponentially faster
5. **Viral Growth:** Social proof + gamification = organic adoption without mandates

## Features

### Phase 1: Zero Friction Entry
- 📧 **No Account Required** - Recipients respond via email link in 30 seconds
- 📊 **Interactive Grid** - When2Meet-style drag-to-select interface
- ⚡ **Instant Results** - See aggregated availability immediately
- 🎯 **Perfect Times** - Automatically highlights when everyone is free

### Phase 2: Whitelist System (Network Effects Engine)
- ⚡ **Whitelist Users** - "Auto-share my availability with Sarah" → instant responses
- 🚀 **Whitelist Domains** - "Trust anyone @acme.com" → company-wide efficiency
- 🔄 **Bilateral Pressure** - "They whitelisted you - return the favor?"
- 📊 **Social Proof** - "5 people at their company already auto-share with you"

### Phase 3: Progressive Enhancement
- 🔐 **Google Calendar Sync** - Auto-fill from calendar (5 second responses)
- 🎯 **Responsiveness Scoring** - ⚡Lightning / 🟢Quick / 🔴Bottleneck badges
- 📈 **Time Savings** - Track minutes saved per team member
- 🔔 **Bilateral Emails** - "John whitelisted you! Connect your calendar?"

### Phase 4: Team Network Effects
- 👥 **Team Dashboard** - Track adoption & responsiveness in real-time
- 🏆 **Domain Leaderboard** - Gamified company rankings
- 📊 **Responsiveness Comparison** - "Your team: 15min avg. Industry: 120min avg."
- 📈 **Viral Loop** - Each interaction creates whitelist opportunities

## Quick Start

### As a Coordinator
1. Navigate to `/requests` (no login required)
2. Enter meeting title, date range, and recipient emails
3. Click "Send" - recipients get email with link
4. View aggregated results as responses come in
5. Share the perfect time slots with everyone

### As a Recipient (No Account)
1. Click link from email
2. See the interactive availability grid
3. Drag to select your available times (30 seconds)
4. Submit and see upgrade benefits
5. Optionally connect calendar for future 5-second responses

### As a Team
1. First user signs up with Google
2. Invites teammates via team dashboard
3. Track adoption and climb the leaderboard
4. Watch scheduling time drop as more join

## Permission System

### Three Consent Levels

**Allow Once** - One-time access for a single meeting request
- Expires after 7 days or when meeting is scheduled

**Trust User** - Ongoing access for a specific person
- View your availability anytime for future meetings
- Revoke access in settings

**Trust Domain** - Access for anyone from an organization
- Example: Trust everyone at @partnercorp.com
- Perfect for frequent cross-team collaboration

## How It Works

### The Viral Loop

1. **First Contact:** Coordinator sends availability request
2. **Frictionless Response:** Recipient marks availability (no account, 30 seconds)
3. **Value Reveal:** After submit, see "Save 25 seconds next time - connect calendar"
4. **Network Effect:** Connected users respond in 5 seconds, encourage teammates
5. **Team Adoption:** Domain leaderboard creates healthy competition
6. **Instant Scheduling:** At scale, all requests auto-filled in seconds

### The Math

- Manual entry: 30 seconds per request
- Calendar connected: 5 seconds per request
- **Time saved: 25 seconds × # of requests**
- At 10 requests/month: **4+ hours saved per year**
- At company scale: **Thousands of hours saved**

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes, PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth 2.0
- **Calendar**: Google Calendar API
- **Email**: SendGrid for transactional emails
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with JSONB for availability data

## Privacy & Security
